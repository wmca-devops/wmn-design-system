## About

  **Buttons** should be used in situations where a user might need to preform an
  action, such as:

  - Submitting a form
  - Uploading
  - Specify a next or previous step in a process
  - Begin a new task

There are two types of button used in this design system - buttons and [link buttons](/components/links/):

  - A **button** performs an action on a page
  - A [link button](/components/links/) takes the user to a different page

Icons should only be used where it is deemed absolutely necessary to communicate the meaning of an action.

---

## Call to action buttons

### What does it do?

  - Encourages the most desired action you want visitors to take.
  - Attracts attention on the page.

### When to use it?

  - When you need a strong visual indicator to help user to complete their journey and do their task.
  - When you need action oriented button. Think: 'Done', 'Save', 'Next', 'Submit'.
  - Use the Dark background variant when a Call to action button will be used against a background with a dark colour, such as primary purple.

### When not to use it?

  - What action you want users to take is not essential in completing their task.
  - When a button is a destructive action.
  - When a button starts a process or journey.

## Primary buttons

### What does it do?

  - Gives users alternative to the call to action button.

### When to use it?

  - When action is not as important as a call to action so it shouldn’t call as much attention.
  - When a button typically indicates actions that are important but not the call to action on a page.
  - Can be used in isolation or in conjunction with call to action button and secondary.

### When not to use it?

  - When a button is essential for continuing the user journey
  - When a button is a destructive action
  - When a button starts a process or journey

### When not to use it?

  - When you need a strong visual indicator to help user to complete their journey and do their task.
  - When a button is essential for continuing the user journey
  - When a button is a destructive action
